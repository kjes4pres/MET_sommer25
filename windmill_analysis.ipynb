    "### Calculation of mean internal Rossby radius\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the impact of wind farms at sea it is useful to make the study area smaller, i.e. not use the whole model domain. The Rossby radius or deformation radius allows us to delimit the area safely while making sure that the relevant dynamics are still within the domain. By taking 1-2 deformation radii as our domain of investigation around the wind farm, we're making sure that the internal dynamics are dominated by internal baroclinic instabilities. As the radius is telling about the length of deformation of a wave, that is a length scaale where the rotation of Earth affects the currents and geostrophy dominates.\n",

    "Sperrevik et al. (2017) calculated the internal Rossby radii using the following method.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_1 = \\frac{c_1}{\\mid f \\mid}$$\n",
    "where $f$ is the local Coriolis parameter and $c_1$ the phase speed of a first mode baroclinic gravity wave. The phase speed can be solved as an eigenvalue problem, but we will deploy the method of Chelton et al. (1998) and use the WKB-approximation.\n",
    "$$R_1 \\approx R_1^{WKB} = \\frac{1}{\\mid f \\mid \\pi}\\int_{-H}^{0}N(z) dz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $H$ is the local water depth and $N$ the buoyancy frequency. Sperrevik et al. (2017) calculated the radius for an area in Northern Norway, Lofoten, as shown in the figure below."
