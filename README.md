### Overview of contents

#### Determining internal baroclinic Rossby radius
* `find_deformation_radius.py`: Module for computing the baroclinic rossby radius. Code partly copied from Ann Kristin Sperrevik, which was a part of the analysis in: https://doi.org/10.1002%2F2016JC012640. Computes the deformation radius and writes to files.
* `N2.py`: Module for computing the buoyancy frequency squared. Code partly copied from Ann Kristin Sperrevik, which was a part of the analysis in: https://doi.org/10.1002%2F2016JC012640.
* `density.py`: Module for getting the density of sea water, from Bjørn Ådlandsvik <bjorn@imr.no>, 07 November 2004.
* `thought_process_rossby.ipynb`: A mess, but parts of the thought process behind. See `\possible_trash` for more.
